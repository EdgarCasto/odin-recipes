Writing this before starting the project:
Instructions are to create a simple recipe website to tackle HTML.
I don't expect to struggle just yet, but we will see at the end.

Writing this after finishing the project:

completed it according to what was expected. VSCode autocompletion
helped when it came to the "style" attribute used in some of the 
elements. 
Perhaps I didn't commit as much as I should.

    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Francesinha is a sandwich, often accompanied by french fries.<br> It has its origins in the city of Porto, Portugal and, despite its many possible variations, the sauce with which it is ladled gives it a very distinct flavour.</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Thick Slices of Loaf Bread</li>
        <li>1 Linguiça</li>
        <li>1 Sausage</li>
        <li>2 Slices of Ham</li>
        <li>1 Steak</li>
        <li>4-6 Slices of Cheese</li>
        <li>1 Egg (optional)</li>
        <li>French Fries (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol style="line-height: 120%;">
        <li>Slightly toast the bread - either in the oven or in the toaster.</li>
        <li>Cook the steak medium/rare.</li>
        <li>Cut the linguiça and sausage, preferably thinly cut, and cook them in the same pan or toaster used for the steak.</li>
        <li>Fry the potatoes and/or egg(s).</li>
        <li>Assemble the ingredients, so as to make a sandwich. The order of the ingredients can be whatever you choose, with the exception of the cheese and egg, which typically go over the top slice of bread - you can also pour some sauce over each ingredient as you assemble the sandwich.</li>
        <li>Place the French Fries all around the sandwich and pour the sauce over everything.</li>
    </ol>
